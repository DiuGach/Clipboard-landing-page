## My process

Hi everyone I hope your are all doing fine, am so excited about this project because this is my 
first coding challenge on frontend ever on frontent mentor, it was full of fun as well as frustration, when I can't figure out what to do, but I have managed which is the exciting part.

it took me almost 4 days to finish this project, and my greatest weekness that I have found while doing this project, is the responsive design, because sometimes when I change the code from another element some begin to breake which was so frustrating, but after all it works, and am kindly resquesting you to have a look, what should I improve on how to approach a coding challenge? thanks for your time.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
what I have learned is you need to practice alot to make easier for you to build projects, build project after project and you definitely realize improvementl.
